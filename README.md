# Digital-Signal-Processing-
Projects done on a DSP development board, using C code 

Done for Ut-Austin's EE445S class taught by Dr. Brian Evans. 

The projects in this folder involve recever and transmitter design, using techniques to extract decoded wavforms and for scrambling waveforms. Techniques Like QAM, PAM, Modulation, demodulation, QPSK, FIR and IIR filter design, etc. were taught

THe sound effects file should have code for applying effects like echo, reverb, etc. to a sound input. We tested ours with a mutual aux. connection form a phone to our board.
